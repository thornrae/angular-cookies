# JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Angular

### Research Conducted By: Taylor Thornton, Nassir Abegaz, Anne Thorsteinson, Arthur Lorenzo Jr.

#### Overall Score and Comments
Score (Out of 10): 5/10

#### General Comments
Describe the stack (front-end only? full stack?), database, efficiency, etc. Describe the general usability and learnability

Angular is a front end framework that provides a typescript implementation to manage state and display on the front end.

##### Pros
Item 1: Clear separation of concerns
Item 2: Typescript allows you to ensure good inputs for your programs

##### Cons
Item 1: Very complex
Item 2: Multiple official tutorials covering the same subject leads to some confusion

#### Ratings and Reviews
Anne: Seems like a steep learning curve, but I like the overall layout and think I would be able to work quickly with it in a few days.

Arthur:  I would need more time to work with this framework and would probably have to go through a tutorial in order to have a better understanding of the work flow.

Nassir:

Taylor: Agree that the learning curve is steep. For novice programmers, I think that this would take a couple weeks to figure out. But, the benefits that typescript offers would likely have significant pay off down the road. 

#### Systems Requirements
Above and beyond ‘node’ and ‘linux’, what dependencies or core requirements exist for this framework? Can it play at AWS/Heroku? Does it require a certain database?

Angular should be agnostic and compatible with different platforms for deployment and database usage.

Ramp-Up Projections
How long would/should it take a team of mid-junior developers to become productive?

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
How popular is this framework? What big companies are running on it? How is it “seen” in the general JS community? Is there an active community of developers supporting and growing it?

Angular is the google product, so the support from it should be substantial.

**Operating Instructions**
At this point the application is not deployed, to get it to run locally one must:

- Clone the repo locally
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `ng server` to start the local server which directs to `localhost:4200`
